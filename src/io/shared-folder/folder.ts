 * another sees it. Everything in `src/io/shared-folder/` reaches the folder only
 * through this interface, so every decision can be driven without a browser.
 *
 * A read that fails is not a missing file. `read` returns `undefined` only when
 * there is no such file, and throws when there is one it cannot read (the sync
 * client holding it, a permission that lapsed). The protocol treats the two
 * differently at every step (spec §5).
