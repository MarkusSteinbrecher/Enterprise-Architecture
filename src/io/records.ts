/**
 * Building a record whose keys came out of a file.
 *
 * `record[key] = value` looks total and is not: assigning `__proto__` invokes
 * the prototype setter rather than creating a property, and with a string value
 * the setter does nothing at all. So a property literally named `__proto__` —
 * legal in both our formats, and a name a real model can carry — was read,
 * assigned, and gone, with `problems: []`.
 *
 * That is the write-side twin of finding 2 of the #37 review, where an untrusted
 * `xsi:type` was *looked up* on a plain object literal and found
 * `Object.prototype`'s member. Both come from treating an object as a dictionary
 * when the key is somebody else's string. On the read side the answer is a `Map`;
 * here it is `Object.defineProperty`, which always makes an own property.
