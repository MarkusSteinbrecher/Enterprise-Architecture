/**
 * The Open Group ArchiMate Model Exchange File Format (concept §5.3 item 2).

 * certified tool reads and writes it, so it is how a model gets in and out of
 * Archipelago without anyone's data being trapped.
 *
 * Written by hand rather than through a serialiser library because the schema
 * pins **element order** (`name`, `documentation`, `properties`) and identifier
 * types (`xs:ID` / `xs:IDREF`), and a generic object-to-XML mapper gives no
 * control over either. Reading uses fast-xml-parser; writing is string building
 * with explicit escaping.
 *
 * Diagrams (`<views>`) and folders (`<organizations>`) are read and written by
 * `exchange-views.ts` (#76). Saved report definitions are not diagrams; the
 * writer carries those as model properties.
