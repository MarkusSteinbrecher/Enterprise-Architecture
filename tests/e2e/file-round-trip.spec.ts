/**
 * Journey 5 — file round trip.
 *
 * Files are the source of truth (concept §5.2) and canonical JSON has to be
 * deterministic (ADR 0004), which together make one assertion worth more than
 * any count: export → import → export must be **byte-identical**. If it is not,
 * the format is not git-friendly and browser storage has quietly become the
 * real repository.
 *
 * Manual counterpart: `tests/manual/file-round-trip.md`.
