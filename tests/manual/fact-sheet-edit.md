# Fact sheet: editing an element

> Verifies that an edit changes the sheet, is named in the history, moves the save-state
> counter by exactly one, and survives closing the tab. **6 minutes.**

## Preconditions

- [ ] Build under test: `<commit SHA or Pages deployment>`
- [ ] Test environment: `<local | preview | github-pages>`
- [ ] Empty browser profile, then **Explore the demo**
- [ ] Note the save-state indicator before you start — after loading the demo it reads
      **LOCAL · 1 UNSAVED**

## Steps

1. In the inventory, click the row **CRM System** — expected: its fact sheet opens, showing
   documentation, lifecycle, portfolio assessment, relations and properties on one screen.
2. Read the right rail — expected: a neighbourhood diagram, an "Appears in" section, and a
   History section saying _No changes to this element in this session._
3. Note the Functional fit — expected: **Unreasonable**, with two of four bars filled.
4. Click **Edit** — expected: the assessment values become dropdowns; the name, documentation
   and lifecycle dates become editable. The button now reads **Done**.
5. Set **Functional fit** to _Perfect_ — expected: the save-state indicator goes up by
   exactly one (to **LOCAL · 2 UNSAVED**), and the History rail gains one entry reading
   _Updated assessment of "CRM System"_. One edit, one line of history, one step on the counter.
   Hover **Undo** in the header — expected: its tooltip reads _Undo: Updated assessment of
   "CRM System"_.
   5a. Press **⌘Z** (Ctrl+Z) — expected: Functional fit is back to _Unreasonable_ and the
   counter goes up by one more (an undo is a change since the last save). Press **⇧⌘Z**
   (Ctrl+Shift+Z or Ctrl+Y) — expected: _Perfect_ again, and one more step on the counter.
   5b. Click into the name field, type a few letters, press **⌘Z** — expected: only the typing
   is undone (the browser's own undo); the fit rating stays _Perfect_.
6. Set **Technical fit** to _Fully adequate_ — expected: one more step on the counter, one
   more history entry.
7. Click **Done** — expected: the dropdowns become values again, showing _Perfect_ and
   _Fully adequate_ with their meters filled to four bars. The completeness ring may change;
   that is fine.
8. Reload the page — expected: the fact sheet comes back with both new values, and the
   save-state indicator reads **LOCAL · SAVED**. A restore is not an edit.
9. Go back to the inventory via the **INVENTORY** breadcrumb — expected: the row for CRM
   System shows the new fits in its Fit F / T column.
10. Type `crm` in the inventory's name filter, open CRM System, then use the **INVENTORY**
    breadcrumb again — expected: you land back on the filtered list, not the unfiltered one.

## Acceptance

- [ ] An edit is visible on the sheet immediately, without a save step
- [ ] Each edit moves the save-state counter by exactly one
- [ ] ⌘Z and ⇧⌘Z undo and redo the model everywhere except inside a text field
- [ ] Each edit adds one history entry that names _what_ changed, not just "modified"
- [ ] Edits survive a reload, and the reload does not itself count as a change
- [ ] The inventory reflects the edit
- [ ] The breadcrumb returns to the inventory with the filters you arrived with

## Notes for the tester

- The save-state counter counts changes since the last save. It counts _every_ change,
  undo and redo included, even one that puts a value back where the file has it.
- The Relations, Assessment and Quality tabs at the top of the sheet are deliberately
  inert — everything lives on Overview for now.
